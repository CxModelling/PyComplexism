# PyABMS
An agent-based modelling toolkit for agent-based modelling and simulation. The package is essentially designed for epidemiologists and health economists. 


### Backbone of PyABMS
We use
- Bayesian Networks for parameter modelling.
- Contiuous-Time Bayesian Networks and Markov Chain for dynamics of agents' states. 
- Monte Carlo and Bayesian inference for post-modelling inference.
